intro:
  title: "Join Our Community of Storytellers"
  content: |
    Fableford offers writers a unique opportunity to create stories in a shared world, where characters interact across narratives and writers collaborate to build something greater than any single author could create alone.
    
    As a Fableford writer, you'll develop your own character, craft compelling stories, and connect with other writers to create a rich tapestry of interconnected narratives. Along the way, you'll build relationships with fellow writers, hone your craft, and earn money from your creative work.

characterCreation:
  title: "Character Creation Guidelines"
  content: |
    In Fableford, your character is your creative anchor - the lens through which you'll experience and contribute to our shared world. Creating a compelling, realistic character is essential for successful storytelling in this collaborative environment.
  cards:
    - title: "Realistic, Relatable Characters"
      icon: "fas fa-id-card"
      description: "Focus on creating believable individuals with everyday concerns, modest aspirations, distinct personalities, and relatable flaws. Fableford isn't about superheroes or chosen ones; it's about ordinary people living authentic lives."
    - title: "Occupation and Residence"
      icon: "fas fa-briefcase"
      description: "Every character needs a role in the community and a place to live. Consider how your character contributes to village life and where they fit in Fableford's geography - from the new Bottom-ford development to the traditional village center."
    - title: "Personal History"
      icon: "fas fa-history"
      description: "Develop a backstory that explains how and why your character came to Fableford. Are they a lifelong resident? A recent arrival? What brought them here or kept them here? What connections do they have to the village?"
    - title: "Goals and Motivations"
      icon: "fas fa-bullseye"
      description: "Define what drives your character in both their public and private lives. What do they want to achieve? What are they hiding? What everyday concerns occupy their thoughts? These elements will drive your storytelling."

lifeFirstStories:
  title: "Life-First Storytelling"
  content: |
    Fableford uses a unique "life-first" approach to storytelling. Rather than beginning with plot and creating characters to serve it, we begin with people living authentic lives and allow stories to emerge organically from their interactions.
  principles:
    - title: "Ordinary People, Extraordinary World"
      content: "Fableford isn't about heroes or exceptional individuals. It's about regular people with everyday concerns forming a community through natural interactions and shared spaces."
    - title: "The Natural Order of Development"
      content: "Just as real communities aren't built overnight, Fableford develops in layers: individual lives, forming connections, community fabric, and finally emerging narratives."
    - title: "Finding Meaning in the Mundane"
      content: "When we stop looking for plot and start observing life, we discover that compelling stories often emerge from seemingly ordinary moments - a newcomer's first impressions, a shopkeeper noticing a customer's changing habits, two neighbors helping each other."
    - title: "The Promise of Meaningful Stakes"
      content: "We make this fundamental promise: No character will die before they have lived. Murder victims won't be introduced at the moment of their death. Tragedies won't befall characters we've just met. Every significant event happens to someone whose life we've witnessed."

collaboration:
  title: "Collaboration Guidelines"
  content: |
    Collaboration is at the heart of Fableford. Our platform is designed to help writers work together to create interconnected stories while maintaining creative control over their own characters.
  guidelines:
    - icon: "fas fa-newspaper"
      title: "The Fableford Gazette"
      description: "Use the Gazette's classifieds section to seek out collaborations, request character relationships, and announce events where multiple characters can interact."
    - icon: "fas fa-comments"
      title: "Direct Communication"
      description: "Connect with other writers through our community platforms to plan and coordinate character interactions, ensuring everyone's creative goals are respected."
    - icon: "fas fa-check-circle"
      title: "Mutual Consent"
      description: "All character interactions require the consent of all writers involved. No writer may control, injure, or significantly affect another writer's character without permission."
    - icon: "fas fa-calendar-alt"
      title: "Timeline Coordination"
      description: "Fableford progresses at a rate of one in-world day per seven real-world days, allowing writers to coordinate timelines across stories for a coherent shared experience."

characterInteractions:
  title: "The Hearsay Principle"
  content: |
    One of the most distinctive aspects of Fableford is our approach to character interactions. In our world, only characters with dedicated writers can exist within scenes and interact directly with other characters.
    
    This means there are no "NPCs" or background characters populating our scenes. Every person your character meets is fully developed and has their own story being written by another author.
  examples:
    acceptable:
      title: "Acceptable References"
      items:
        - "Distant Communication: \"Eleanor received an email from her publisher in London.\""
        - "Mentions in Conversation: \"Eleanor told Alice about her childhood in Devon.\""
        - "Memories: \"She recalled her professor's advice about classic literature.\""
        - "Indirect Knowledge: \"According to the morning news, the mayor had announced budget cuts.\""
        - "Abstract References: \"Her readers often requested more mystery novels.\""
    problematic:
      title: "Problematic References to Avoid"
      items:
        - "Physical Presence: \"Customers browsed the bookshop while Eleanor organized displays.\""
        - "Direct Interaction: \"The delivery person handed her the package with a smile.\""
        - "Naming Individuals: \"John, her assistant, organized the book shipment.\""
        - "Specific Dialogue: \"Her mother called to say she'd visit next weekend.\""
        - "Detailed Descriptions: \"The tall barista with the red hair always remembered her order.\""
