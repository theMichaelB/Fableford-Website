## Brief Description

John is a weathered journalist with sharp, attentive eyes that have seen more than most. His measured movements and thoughtful pauses reflect decades spent observing and analyzing. Despite adopting the name "John" professionally, he occasionally wrestles with his cultural identity as Jamal.

## Personality

John is deeply cynical, having witnessed the decline of journalistic integrity throughout his career. He maintains a stubborn persistence when investigating stories, refusing to let go once his interest is piqued. Despite his outward gruffness, he harbors an unwavering belief in the public's right to truth. His approach is methodical and detail-oriented, with a particular talent for detecting deception through people's word choices.

## Background

John worked for all the major UK newspapers during his extensive career, experiencing both the heights of investigative journalism and the ethical low points during the phone hacking scandal. The latter left him disillusioned with mainstream media, prompting him to shift to smaller publications where he could maintain some integrity. He now balances his semi-retirement with occasional investigative pieces and work on a book exposing journalism's inner workings.

## Current Situation

John is pursuing a corruption case involving the local mayor despite resistance from his editor/boss Tom, who has conflicting business interests. His car is currently broken, forcing him to conduct meetings at The Happy Place café. He's interviewing Jane Potter for a graduate journalist position, potentially seeking an ally in his investigation.

## Connections

- Tom (Editor/Boss): A complex relationship marked by cultural tension and professional frustration, with Tom frequently using John's birth name Jamal as a manipulation tactic.
- Jane Potter: A promising young journalist whom John is interviewing and might see as reminiscent of his younger self.
- Alice: The café owner with whom John has friendly customer-proprietor interactions.
