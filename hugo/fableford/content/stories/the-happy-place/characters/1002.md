## Brief Description

Alice radiates a warm, genuine energy that makes everyone feel instantly welcome in her presence. Her movements behind the counter of The Happy Place are practiced and graceful, a testament to the pride she takes in her work. Her expressive face and infectious smile create an aura of joyfulness that draws people to her.

## Personality

Alice exhibits natural empathy, remembering details about her customers' lives and forming immediate connections with people like Jane. Her warmth and generosity stem directly from her upbringing by a mother who showed her that love and kindness could flourish even in difficult circumstances. Alice's strong work ethic and resilience were shaped by watching her mother's unwavering determination, instilling in her a deep-seated appreciation for community and the ability to find happiness in simple pleasures rather than material wealth.

## Background

Alice grew up in a modest home in a working-class neighborhood of Northern England with her single mother, who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. Despite their financial struggles, Alice's mother created a loving, nurturing environment, prioritizing their bond and Alice's wellbeing above all else. Though they couldn't afford luxuries or expensive opportunities, Alice's childhood was rich in love, values, and the strong work ethic modeled by her mother. After completing her basic education, Alice immediately entered the workforce, cycling through various service industry jobs – waitressing, retail, and eventually café work where she discovered her passion for creating welcoming spaces. When the opportunity to purchase the former hardware store in Fableford arose, her mother made the significant sacrifice of mortgaging her small home to help Alice secure the down payment needed to purchase and convert the space into The Happy Place. The café represents not just Alice's dream and livelihood, but also her mother's belief in her and the culmination of values instilled throughout her upbringing.

## Current Situation

Alice is newly married to Sophie and running her café with infectious enthusiasm, finding daily joy in creating a welcoming space for the community. She lives with Sophie in the apartment above The Happy Place, maintaining regular contact with her mother who remains her biggest supporter. While her business isn't tremendously profitable, it provides enough for her needs, and she takes particular pride in how The Happy Place has become a community hub. 

## Connections

- Sophie: Her wife, whose privileged upbringing and sophisticated education create a complementary contrast to Alice's more modest background; their different perspectives enrich their relationship.
