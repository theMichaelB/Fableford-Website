## Brief Description

Tom is a shrewd businessman with a calculating demeanor masked behind a veneer of casual camaraderie. He has a commanding presence and speaks with a volume that often draws attention, whether intentional or not. His well-dressed appearance and confident stance reflect his self-image as a successful entrepreneur, though his ethics remain questionable at best.

## Personality

Tom is fundamentally opportunistic, viewing relationships—both personal and professional—primarily as transactions where he can leverage power. He uses cultural connections manipulatively, such as emphasizing John's birth name "Jamal" only when attempting to establish false camaraderie or extract favors. Though outwardly successful, he harbors deep insecurities that manifest as controlling behaviors, particularly toward women. His ethical flexibility leads him to dismiss corruption as "just business," showing a moral relativism that guides his decisions.

## Background

Tom comes from the same cultural background as John, which he uses as a manipulation tactic despite having largely distanced himself from those roots in pursuit of business success. He has built a portfolio of businesses beyond the newspaper, many of which rely on government contracts, creating conflicts of interest that influence his editorial decisions. His marriage is strained, with his wife frequently traveling and described by Tom as "a chore" who "whines a lot." This dissatisfaction has led to his affair with Josephine, the local B&B owner.

## Current Situation

Tom is currently balancing multiple precarious situations: preventing John from publishing a corruption exposé that could jeopardize his government contracts, maintaining his secret affair with Josephine whom he financially supports while exerting control over her, and managing his newspaper while his wife is away in Morocco. He's driving to meet John at The Happy Place café specifically to reject the corruption story, showing irritation about having to make the trip due to John's broken car.

## Connections

- John (Jamal): His employee whose investigative journalism threatens Tom's business interests; Tom deliberately uses John's birth name as a manipulation tactic.
- Josephine: The local B&B owner with whom Tom is having an affair, exhibiting controlling behaviours and providing financial support.
