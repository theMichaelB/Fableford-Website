## Brief Description

Jane is a fresh-faced Cambridge graduate with an energetic demeanor that occasionally falters when her personal anxieties surface. She abandoned her birth name Guðbjørnsdatter at university, adopting her maternal grandfather's surname Potter to avoid constant mispronunciations and questions. Her intelligent eyes and attentive posture reveal her journalistic instincts even in casual conversation.

## Personality

Jane possesses a natural investigative instinct, quickly identifying the core issues in complex situations and pursuing them with determination. Despite her academic success and intelligence, she harbors insecurities about her personal identity, having changed her surname and still processing emotional vulnerabilities from her recent breakup. She balances earnestness with a sharp wit, unafraid to match verbal sparring with more experienced professionals like John. Her responses are quick and thoughtful, revealing both her academic training and innate talent for journalism.

## Background

Jane recently graduated from Cambridge University with a first-class degree in International Relations, having chosen this path largely inspired by John Doyle's investigative journalism. Her father, who has been largely absent from her life, gave her the Icelandic surname Guðbjørnsdatter that she struggled with until abandoning it during her first week at university. She has deep connections to Fableford through her maternal grandfather, Bernard Potter, a former local councilor who owned the hardware store that later became The Happy Place café. Her relationship with her boyfriend ended just before her return to Fableford, adding emotional turmoil to her professional transition.

## Current Situation

Jane has returned to Fableford after completing her degree, bringing all her possessions in her small Volkswagen Polo. She is interviewing with John Doyle for a graduate journalist position at the local paper while staying with her grandfather. The interview coincidentally takes place in what was once her grandfather's hardware store, adding a layer of nostalgia to her professional opportunity. She is still processing her recent breakup and the transition from university to professional life.
