## Brief Description

Sophie is a striking woman of Nigerian descent with a tall, strong frame and an artist's observant eyes that miss little. Her elegant movements contrast with her occasional moments of intense focus when sketching or analyzing a situation. She carries herself with quiet confidence that hints at her law enforcement background, despite her current artistic pursuits.

## Personality

Sophie possesses keen observational skills honed from both her artistic eye and her law enforcement family background, allowing her to read people and situations with unusual clarity. She struggles with the duality of her nature – the practical, analytical mindset inherited from her police family and her passionate, creative artistic self. Though generally warm and thoughtful, she can become intensely focused when something captures her attention, momentarily detaching from her surroundings. She harbors a deep sentimentality for places and moments, as evidenced by her emotional connection to Paris and Notre Dame.

## Background

Sophie was born in the UK to a Nigerian family with deep ties to law enforcement. Her father rose through the police ranks and now holds a semi-political office, while her mother worked in an investigative capacity for the Home Office. Sophie spent formative years in Paris when her mother was stationed at the UK embassy

From her early teens, Sophie convinced her parents to let her attend boarding school in Paris, and she later went on to study art history at the Sorbonne. Her life took an unexpected turn when she wandered into Alice's café and experienced an immediate, life-changing connection that eventually led her to abandon her plans to return to Paris permanently and instead build a life in Fableford.

## Éducation

- Licence Histoire de l’Art et Archéologie, Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne
- Master Histoire de l’Art (spécialité: art moderne et muséologie), Sorbonne Université
- Formation complémentaire, École du Louvre (cours de muséologie)

## Current Situation

Sophie is newly married to Alice, the owner of The Happy Place café, and is adjusting to life in small-town Fableford after having lived in London and Paris. She divides her time between creating art – often from the window of their apartment overlooking the town square or within the café itself – and supporting Alice's business while struggling with occasional nostalgia for Paris

## Connections

- Alice: Her wife and source of boundless joy, whose presence made Sophie choose Fableford over Paris; their relationship represents Sophie's present happiness and future.
