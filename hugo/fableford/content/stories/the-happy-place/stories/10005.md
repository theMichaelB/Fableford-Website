title: "Tom's Perspective"
---

[Tom's](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1005) phone vibrated on the passenger seat next to him, his watch followed shortly after, he glanced at his wrist to see yet another camel picture. "Jesus, you're supposed to be there working," he complained at his phone. He was frustrated, his wife was traveling in Morocco, or some other dumb part of the world pretending that people gave a damn about what she had to say. She was a chore to be around most of the time, but she kept the house well and she took the burden of doing stuff he didn't care for. She had a tendency to whine a lot, but he could tune that out and get on with what he had to do. 

He pulled into the cafe car park. "The fucking happy place, what a ridiculous name," he muttered to himself. People just want to get their drinks and be left in peace. The chime of the bell as he entered was nearly as irritating as the fake customer service enthusiasm that came from behind the counter. 

[John](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1001) was stood at the counter chatting, so he sat down and started looking through the folder on the table. 

John came and sat down and immediately started whining about how important the case was like it was the end of the fucking world he was reporting. Tom mostly ignored him, and started flicking through the documents. Jesus, this shit could ruin him. 

As that thought sat in his mind, that stupid chime sounded again as somebody walked in behind him. He turned to see who it was. There was a tall, dark, surprisingly attractive woman standing just inside [the cafe](/stories/the-happy-place/locations/101), casually surveying the faces there. Finally her gaze reached him. He caught himself smiling at her, then immediately retracted it, but it was too late, he had shown his hand and she had seen it, she returned no reaction at all. 

He watched her eyes scanning over the papers in his hand and across the desk. A gentle panic released inside him, clenching around his stomach. Then her gaze shifted away. She smiled, her stance and persona softened, and [she](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1003) glided into the arms of the [fake customer service girl](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1002), whose glee was clearly no longer fake.

He sat in the silence of that panic as John continued droning in the background. He didn't know who she was, but he didn't like her proximity to any of this. He needed to kill this story, but couldn't do it outright, otherwise this stubborn bastard would just dig in deeper. The best he could do was delay it, never giving it enough air to breathe.

Though it wasn't entirely useless, he could definitely use the information in there to grease some wheels in his favor. Some contracts in his pipeline could suddenly become much more lucrative.

As he thought this, the dark woman passed behind him to get to the table next to them. He felt her slow down as she passed, and knew she was looking at the contents of the table.

Damn it John, you really are going to screw everything up. He told him to go and work on it some more, and left that incessant place.
