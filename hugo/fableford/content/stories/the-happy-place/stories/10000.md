The slow vibration of [Alice's](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1002) watch was a favourite moment of [Sophie's](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1003) day. She was either awake to hear it, or so attuned to it that it woke her up before Alice had chance to stir. Her perfect face poking out from the mountain of bedding she had stolen. Sophie would always wake up to a lingering chill across her skin, but that was a small price for the moments that her wife would watch her, pretending, to sleep. 

Every morning, Sophie wanted to lean in and kiss her. But she stayed still, basking in the quiet adoration she could feel flowing from her. The warmth in Alice's gaze was like sunlight on closed eyelids. Soft, radiant, and impossibly tender. Sophie adored being seen by her.

Usually she would wait the full five minutes before her alarm would make her drag herself out of her protective fortress. Today though, she waited barely a minute before the chaos of limbs and cloth began to separate into distinct entities. She wanted to reach out to let her know that whatever demon was circling her head today, that it didn't matter because they had each other. But she was supposed to be asleep, and if Alice thought she was awake in the mornings when she woke, it might stop her from seeing her.

As always she smiled as her wife attempted to leave the room quietly. She didn't really understand how anybody could make so much noise walking from one room to the next. 

Alice pulled the door to behind her, as the morning sunlight from the next room disappeared Sophie pulled herself up and reclaimed her side of the bedding. 

She listened for the kettle being filled, as her wife prepared for the new day. But instead there was silence, she waited a few more moments, tuned to any sound that her wife might make. But still, silence. 

She drew a breath, she would have to risk letting the secret out, she could just blame it on her particularly loud foot steps. 

She carefully slipped from the bed, and peeked through the crack in the door, gently expanding the gap to see more fully. 

Her wife was standing in front of Paris, she stepped forward and reached out to touch, tentative and intimate. The sun was on the brink of fully entering the room, until then its reflected rays cast her in a magnificent aura. She wanted to pause that moment so she could paint it. Instead she lingered there, watching the watcher. Wishing with all of her soul that she could quell the demons that she lived with. 

But Alice's demons were out in force, and she needed to know it was all going to be fine. 

Sophie pulled the door firmly. So that the hinges would announce her presence. She saw the rise of her breathing hesitate and her breathing quicken. She didn't need to be able to see her face to know there were tears building in her eyes. 

She crossed the room quickly, and wrapped her arms around her, no words were needed. Her presence was enough. 

They both stood looking at Paris, Sophie holding her wife, wondering what she saw when she looked. Wishing she could see through her eyes.

Sophie had never truly experienced doubt. She moved through life with the quiet conviction that her choices were right, felt, instinctively, in her bones.

But Alice doubted everything. Second-guessed everything.

And yetâ€¦ what did she see in the world that gave her such effortless, boundless joy?

To perfectly punctuate the moment, Alice's self doubt stepped up. 

"Wil I ever get to know what this is worth?"

The question was simple, the answer was simple. It was just a number, but Sophie was ashamed of the answer, and Alice was afraid of it. 

But the number wasn't what Alice wanted, she just wanted the demon who asked it to die, and she wanted Sophie to be the one to step up and banish it. 

Sophie didn't have an answer, she felt her own disappointment rise up to her throat. So in lieu of words, she held on tightly, and promised to never let her slip away.
