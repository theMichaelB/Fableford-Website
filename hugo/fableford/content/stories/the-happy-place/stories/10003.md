[Sophie](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1003) looked out of the window over the main square of Fableford. Half watching people going by, half daydreaming. It was the state of mind she found herself in when she wasn't sure what to draw. It was strange that her life was now so contained in this village, knowing the name of every house on every street, and every person who lived there.

For the last few days she had found herself wanting to paint the view from her window in Paris. Overlooking the Seine with the Louvre and Notre Dame as a backdrop, with endless streets, and endless people.

She wondered what that view was like today, now that the rebuild was mostly complete. That was what she wanted to draw, how it might look now. But every time she thought of it, the ache returned, deep and unshakable. Notre Dame had always been the heart of the city for her, the beacon of beauty, charity, and hope. A constant presence in her life, watching over her from every bridge, every quiet street she had wandered. But that night, the fire swallowed the sky, and for the first time, the cathedral was no longer a guardian; it was helpless. The flames bled into the Seine, their reflected glow stretching across the water like an open wound. It was as if the city itself was burning, its magic turning to smoke. And in that moment, the Paris she had known, the Paris she had loved, was gone. Even now, if she let the memory linger too long, she could feel the tears welling up once more.

Allowing herself to think of Paris felt dangerously close to yearning for the life she'd left behind, as if by remembering it fondly, she might somehow betray [Alice](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1002). Alice, who deserved her whole heart, undivided. Alice, who made her realise that home wasn't a place, but a person.

A year ago, she knew, absolutely and completely, that she would spend the rest of her life in Paris. Even if she didn't have the money and privilege that she enjoyed. She would wait tables, and do whatever else she had to do to stay. Since she was eight years old she knew she belonged there.

Then she wandered into Alice's café, [Alice's Happy Place Café](/stories/the-happy-place/locations/101). In that moment, everything changed. Over the following months she found herself craving to be in Alice's presence, craving the happiness she set loose in her soul. Even if they never spoke, she wanted to sit in that café and draw her face, every single day for the rest of her life.

She tried to give in to it. She went and visited, in the hope that the infatuation would pass and she could get her old thoughts back. Instead she fell deeper with every day, further away from Paris with every breath. She loved Paris, but it simply couldn't compare to what she had now.

She let out a slow breath, forcing herself to pull away from the memory before it swallowed her whole. Paris was her past, a beautiful, aching ghost. But as her eyes drifted across the square, they found Alice, her bright, irreplaceable present. Through the café window, she could see her wife laughing as she handed a customer their coffee, the warmth in her expression so effortless, so real. The sight settled something inside Sophie, easing the ache in her chest. What was she doing, chasing shadows when the light she truly needed was right here?

Sophie looked out of [the window](/stories/the-happy-place/locations/102) over Fableford, half daydreaming watching her wife across the square, spreading joy and love into the world. She knew exactly what she was going to draw. She was going to go and sit in that café, and draw her wife's beautiful face.
