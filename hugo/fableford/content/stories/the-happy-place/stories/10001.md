The slow vibration of [Alice's](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1002) watch pulled her out of her slumber, as she reached under the covers to grasp it with her other hand she wasn't sure whether it had woken her, or if she'd been awake for a while. She wasn't sure whether she had been dreaming of her wife, or simply watching her sleep. Either way, she had five minutes before the vibration would start again, so she continued watching. In the back of her mind, the usual doubts jostled for attention. Self-doubt was the reigning champion, so she looked at her [wife](/stories/the-happy-place/characters/1003) and wondered why she had given up so much to be here. 

While it had never been actually said between them, they both knew that Alice wouldn't have hesitated in giving up everything she had to move to Paris and be a part of whatever life she had there. It was never said, because Sophie had already given up everything to be here, in this town, in this bed. In her life. 

She just wished, for a second, that she understood why. 

She quietly unfurled herself from the mountain of duvet she had spent the night hording, and slipped from the bed, walking as quietly as she could across the creaks and complaints of the early morning floor boards. 

In the next room, there was a wall where Sophie had hung an assortment of pictures. Mostly her own, the picture of Alice always caught her eye first. Because she loved it, and hated it. There was too much truth in it for Alice's comfort, but also it was the truth that only Sophie had access to. Other drawings and paintings were scattered around, there was a lovely water colour of [The Happy Place](/stories/the-happy-place/locations/101), that always brought a little bounce of joy to Alice's soul. 

 At the centre of all of those pictures was the painting that had pulled her from her bed. A softly coloured scene of Notre Dame, its towers placing a casual presence, like it just happened to be there while the painter was looking at the river. The Seine shimmered in the foreground, Alice had spent time looking at that river. It was important to Sophie, and she wanted to understand it. The colours were strangely out of place, yet perfectly fitting. Sophie talked about how alive it was, how the river flowed and the trees rustled, Alice didn't see any of that, but it was very pretty. But she was always spellbound when Sophie talked about art. But that was just because talking about art brought her entire being to life. 

She reached out and touched the signature in the bottom right, there were no discernable letters, but apparently it belonged to Gustave Loiseau. Alice had never heard of him until the painting arrived in an armoured truck. Which, as it turned out, was only the beginning of the ordeal. The insurance forms, the cameras, the very intense air conditioning man. It was allâ€¦ a lot.

But it brought Sophie joy. So it brought Alice joy too.

She had tried to look it up one night, there was almost nothing about it, she found a thread that gossiped about its existence, but most of the responses explained, emphatically, like only the internet can, why it could never have existed, and was certainly never commissioned, the painting she was looking at simply didn't exist, and couldn't exist. 

And yet here it was. A secret treasure buried in her wife's past. 

She heard the bedroom door open behind her, followed by the soft sound of bare feet against the varnished floorboards.

The floor always creaked under Alice's steps. But not under Sophie's. Sophie moved like a whisper. 
Graceful, elegant, ephemeral.

Of course she did, murmured the ghost of Christmas future. She was the kind of beauty that slipped through cracks in time. The kind of person who made you afraid to blink, just in case she vanished when your eyes reopened.

That thought caught in Alice's breath. She exhaled sharply, trying to stop the tear pooling in her eye before it had the nerve to fall.

She didn't turn around. She just waited.

Alice stood there, in silence, with the quiet anticipation of Sophie's touch, the soft firmness of her hand as it slipped into the gap between her shorts, and her oversized, overly worn out, Goofy T-shirt. After a short eternity of waiting it came. The slow electricity of touch. 

They lingered in that moment, Sophie's chin coming to rest on Alice's shoulder. Both of them gazing at the sunset in the picture, as the sun rose into their room. 

"Will you ever tell me what this is worth?" 

There was a moment before she answered. A moment where nothing was said. A long, long moment. Alice heard, or maybe felt. Perhaps just imagined, a barely perceptible catch in her breath. She desperately wanted to turn around to see if there was a tear following in its wake. But she wasn't sure her world could take the catastrophic damage it would cause her heart. 

"It is just a memory, what price can you put to a memory"

"But I know you miss it, I know how much you adored all of that memory."

"It is a memory of a past that I was once enthralled by. But none of that compares to what I have right here." Sophie pulled her in tightly, as they both held on to the hope of the future they were forging together.
