## Description

The apartment occupies the second floor of a historic building on the opposite side of Fableford's town square from The Happy Place café. Its most distinctive feature is a spacious bay window that offers a perfect view of the café across the square. The apartment is notably larger than the small flat above the café where Alice initially lived, providing ample space for both women's needs. The interior beautifully blends Sophie's refined artistic sensibilities with Alice's warm, cozy aesthetic – carefully curated art pieces and mementos from Sophie's time in Paris complement comfortable furniture adorned with colorful throws selected by Alice. The bay window alcove has been transformed into Sophie's drawing space, with excellent natural light and the perfect vantage point to observe the comings and goings at The Happy Place.

## History

The apartment was previously owned by an elderly resident who had lived there for decades. When Sophie and Alice decided to marry, they quickly realized that Alice's small flat above the café wouldn't comfortably accommodate them both. The timing was fortuitous as this apartment with its perfect view of The Happy Place had just come on the market. Sophie purchased it as both a wedding gift to Alice and a commitment to their future in Fableford. While Sophie could have afforded something grander, this apartment's bay window and its position directly across from The Happy Place made it the perfect choice – allowing her to maintain a visual connection to Alice throughout the day.

## Significance

The apartment represents Sophie's commitment to building a life in Fableford with Alice, a physical manifestation of her choice to leave Paris behind. The bay window has particular significance as Sophie's creative space where she can both practice her art and maintain a visual connection to Alice throughout the day. For Alice, the apartment represents a significant upgrade from her small flat above the café and symbolizes how her life has expanded through her relationship with Sophie. The location allows them to maintain the perfect balance – close enough to The Happy Place for convenience, yet separate enough to create a distinction between work and home life.
