  title: "A New Kind of Storytelling"
  content: |
    Fableford represents a fundamental shift in how stories are created and experienced. Instead of beginning with plot and creating characters to serve it, we begin with people living authentic lives and allow stories to emerge organically from their interactions.

    Unlike traditional storytelling platforms, Fableford is built on the principle of **life-first storytelling**. Our characters aren't special because of remarkable abilities or destinies. They're special because they're fully realized people with histories, habits, hopes, and fears—just like those we encounter in real life.

    This approach creates storytelling with genuine emotional resonance: when a character faces a crisis, readers care because they've already witnessed their everyday life and connections.

      title: "Character Interaction System"
      description: |
        Our unique approach ensures that every character in Fableford has a dedicated writer. There are no "NPCs" or background characters—every person your character meets is fully developed and has their own ongoing story.
        
        This creates genuine community building rather than interacting with disposable background characters.
    - icon: "fas fa-newspaper"
      title: "The Fableford Gazette"
      description: |
        Our in-world newspaper serves both as a narrative element and a coordination tool for writers. It features classifieds where characters can seek interactions, announce events, or request specific character types needed for their stories.
        
        The Gazette helps maintain narrative cohesion while facilitating organic collaboration.

      title: "Reader-Driven Discovery"
      description: |
        Rather than algorithmic recommendations, Fableford employs organic, human-driven discovery mechanisms. Readers can explore stories through character relationships, reader-curated collections, or by following particular locations or themes.
        
        This ensures readers find content that genuinely resonates with them.
    - icon: "fas fa-balance-scale"
      title: "Canon Management System"
      description: |
        Our framework maintains narrative consistency while preserving creative freedom. Writers can self-designate their content as canon (following established world-building) or non-canon (for creative exploration beyond core elements).
        
        This allows for both coherent storytelling and creative experimentation.

socialMedia:
  title: "Beyond Social Media: Creative Collaboration"
  content: |
    Fableford represents a fundamental reimagining of digital social spaces. Rather than optimizing for fleeting attention, viral spread, or passive consumption, we create meaningful social connections through collaborative creation.

    Unlike traditional social media platforms that rely on broadcasting content into algorithmic voids, Fableford transforms social interaction by placing collaborative creation at its core:

    - **Create Together**: Form connections by making something meaningful with others
    - **Sustained Relationships**: Develop partnerships that deepen over time
    - **Tangible Outcomes**: Produce creative work that exists beyond fleeting engagement
    - **Purpose-Driven Connection**: Interact with intent rather than algorithm-driven suggestion
    - **Quality Over Quantity**: Value depth of connection rather than follower counts
